There were no confirmed reports of increased ICE activity in Chicago, said Cassio Mendoza, a spokesman for Mayor Brandon Johnson.\\n\\nMr. Johnson, a Democrat, said on social media that Mr. Trump‚Äôs latest post was ‚Äúbeneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution.‚Äù\\n\\nGov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, called the post ‚Äúnot normal.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄùThe President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIllinois won‚Äôt be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.‚Äù\\n\\nChicagoans came out in force against Mr. Trump in the city‚Äôs downtown on Saturday afternoon, as a demonstration drew thousands of people who protested the prospect of increased ICE arrests and the president‚Äôs plan to bring the National Guard into the city.\\n\\nAs he stood among the gathering throng, Scott Smith, 50, said he had weighed whether or not to make the trek from his South Side neighborhood of Morgan Park to attend the rally.\\n\\n‚ÄúHonestly, what made me realize I needed to be here was when I saw Trump‚Äôs social media post this afternoon,‚Äù Mr. Smith said. ‚ÄúI was on the fence, and then I saw he was declaring war on an American city, my city.‚Äù\\n\\nMr. Smith, who works in local government, said he would support a role for federal support for fighting crime in the city, but he said that any meaningful help would require coordination with city leaders and police.\\n\\n‚ÄúAsk the people who know the city best, and they will tell you, what Trump is doing is not helpful,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs creating distrust and disruption, and quite frankly, I think it‚Äôs intended to create violence that he can use to justify more intervention.‚Äù\\n\\nMr. Trump has targeted Chicago for weeks, following large-scale immigration raids in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\\n\\nProtesters also marched in Washington on Saturday, objecting to Mr. Trump‚Äôs actions in the district, particularly his seizing control of the Metropolitan Police Department, the first time a president has done so.\\n\\nIn Illinois, ICE has made at least 1,400 immigration arrests since Mr. Trump took office, a much lower rate per capita than in other immigrant-heavy states like New York. More than 1,000 of those arrests have been in the Chicago area.\\n\\nLegal experts have questioned whether Mr. Trump, who has also sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, would have the authority to send them to Chicago over the governor‚Äôs objections.\\n\\nThe anticipated crackdown coincided with a typically raucous time in the city, as celebrations of Mexican Independence Day were to begin. Most Latinos in Chicago are of Mexican descent, and each year thousands attend parades, fly Mexican flags from their cars and form caravans.\\n\\nAndy Grimm, Robert Chiarito and Catherine Cheney contributed reporting.\",\"canonical_link\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/us/trump-chicago-ice-raids-immigration.html\",\"meta_site_name\":\"\",\"publish_date\":\"2025-09-06T00:00:00\"},{\"title\":\"Japan PM Ishiba resigns after bruising election losses\",\"read_more_link\":\"\",\"meta_keywords\":[\"MTPIX\",\"BACT\",\"BIZ\",\"BOSS1\",\"DIP\",\"ECO\",\"GEN\",\"MCE\",\"MNGISS\",\"NEWS1\",\"PLCY\",\"POL\",\"PPLMOV\",\"VOTE\",\"VOTH\",\"EASIA\",\"ASXPAC\",\"ASIA\",\"JP\",\"DEST:OUSWDM\",\"DEST:SEATP\",\"DEST:OUSTPM\",\"DEST:OCATPM\",\"PACKAGE:US-TOP-NEWS\",\"PACKAGE:WORLD-NEWS\",\"MTVID\",\"DEST:CSA\",\"DEST:LBY\",\"DEST:REULB\",\"DEST:ABX\",\"DEST:G\",\"DEST:RAST\",\"DEST:SOF\",\"DEST:J\",\"DEST:M\",\"DEST:PGE\",\"DEST:RNP\",\"DEST:E\",\"DEST:C\",\"DEST:AFA\",\"DEST:BNX\",\"DEST:GRO\",\"DEST:PSC\",\"DEST:U\",\"DEST:O\",\"DEST:DNP\",\"DEST:MTL\",\"DEST:FUN\",\"DEST:UCDPTEST\",\"DEST:RWSA\",\"DEST:GNS\",\"DEST:RWS\",\"DEST:D\",\"DEST:RBN\",\"DEST:OIL\",\"CEN\",\"INT\",\"DEST:OUKTPM\",\"TOPNWS\",\"TOPCMB\",\"POTUS\",\"SECUR\",\"CWP\",\"WASH\",\"AMERS\",\"US\",\"NAMER\"],\"language\":\"en\",\"images\":[\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LGS4UTV6BZJWVFU6AFT3ZXR5UY.jpg?auth=42a59e794070f627ebfc9ca9428d7ba453abd2eb79e7a736159b29ff3d388720&width=4208&quality=80\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com%2Freuters%2FH24NV3AFCZCWPC463OG3JRYY7U.jpg?auth=4dd3566d980534ddab2fb815cfdf9f08e04ca3d4f4dd0c88f6e42931b1e77167&width=120&quality=80\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3JN2WQKGWFLPVF7OWSAVROIITU.jpg?auth=c4ffab482c6676c82f1bf7ecba277ce69bada3c95b693ddfa72ac61b9a42c485&width=960&quality=80\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2UY6XEYMIFIRPHARDPFY3XSRUE.jpg?auth=f27fdeb643e2f66347053edd1f18df8f11e7c67eff162748c080a4156e45d0ee&width=960&quality=80\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BZ75G2KZ4RKN3KUWFPMHSZ7MG4.jpg?auth=4faf3420fd5ad8e3515bc730f6ac4e829168820c3ba205cf131182dd2b542e56&width=960&quality=80\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EPCC4KXORFPKZFADRZPZJJJONU.jpg?auth=69467c5806fc01be928333358d199a4af56f43897114acc7dba3215307a0f2ef&width=960&quality=80\",\"https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/AE6BNNRLSVAQTFG5XHTC4AV6YI.jpg\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LGS4UTV6BZJWVFU6AFT3ZXR5UY.jpg?auth=42a59e794070f627ebfc9ca9428d7ba453abd2eb79e7a736159b29ff3d388720&width=1200&quality=80\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EPCC4KXORFPKZFADRZPZJJJONU.jpg?auth=69467c5806fc01be928333358d199a4af56f43897114acc7dba3215307a0f2ef&width=960&quality=80\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&width=960&quality=80\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPUY5LKXIZOG3JABTNHFS5CZAY.jpg?auth=67e50152487cf37b67c97a58f87849d6f27964886b495bdbc0a48bcb8e675429&width=960&quality=80\",\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RDRTOPZFQFIBPBJLTMI4LI7KQI.jpg?auth=71d9f45c6e89cdc48d1075645c14c53a49d9cd87cc1a695c270ebd3b57541fca&width=960&quality=80\"],\"meta_favicon\":\"/pf/resources/images/reuters/favicon/tr_fvcn_kinesis_32x32_v2.ico?d=311\",\"meta_img\":\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LGS4UTV6BZJWVFU6AFT3ZXR5UY.jpg?auth=42a59e794070f627ebfc9ca9428d7ba453abd2eb79e7a736159b29ff3d388720&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true\",\"authors\":[\"Yuka Obayashi\",\"Nobuhiro Kubo\",\"Leika Kihara\"],\"keywords\":[],\"meta_lang\":\"en\",\"summary\":\"\",\"movies\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.reuters.com/world/japan-pm-ishiba-resigns-after-bruising-election-losses-2025-09-07/\",\"top_image\":\"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LGS4UTV6BZJWVFU6AFT3ZXR5UY.jpg?auth=42a59e794070f627ebfc9ca9428d7ba453abd2eb79e7a736159b29ff3d388720&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true\",\"meta_description\":\"Shigeru Ishiba's resignation ushers in a potentially lengthy period of policy uncertainty at a shaky moment for the world's fourth-largest economy.\",\"text\":\"TOKYO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba resigned on Sunday, ushering in a potentially lengthy period of policy uncertainty at a shaky moment for the world's fourth-largest economy.\\n\\nHaving just ironed out final details of a trade deal with the United States to lower President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs, Ishiba, 68, told a press conference he must take responsibility for a series of bruising election losses.\\n\\nSign up here.\\n\\nSince coming to power less than a year ago, the unlikely premier has overseen his ruling coalition lose its majorities in elections for both houses of parliament amid voter anger over rising living costs.\\n\\nHe instructed his Liberal Democratic Party - which has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war period - to hold an emergency leadership race, adding he would continue his duties until his successor was elected.\\n\\n\\\"With Japan having signed the trade agreement and the president having signed the executive order, we have passed a key hurdle,\\\" Ishiba said, his voice seeming to catch with emotion. \\\"I would like to pass the baton to the next generation.\\\"\\n\\nIshiba has faced calls to resign since the latest of those losses in an election for the upper house in July. The LDP had been scheduled to hold a vote on whether to hold an extraordinary leadership election on Monday.\\n\\nKOIZUMI, TAKAICHI AMONG POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS\\n\\nConcern over political uncertainty prompted a sell-off in Japan's yen currency and its government bonds last week, with the yield on the 30-year bond hitting a record high on Wednesday.\\n\\nInvestors are focusing on the chance of Ishiba being replaced by an advocate of looser fiscal and monetary policy, such as LDP veteran Sanae Takaichi, who has criticised the Bank of Japan's interest rate hikes.\\n\\nIshiba narrowly defeated Takaichi in last year's LDP leadership run-off. Shinjiro Koizumi, the telegenic political scion who has gained prominence as Ishiba's farm minister tasked with trying to cap soaring prices, is another possible successor.\\n\\n\\\"Given the political pressure mounting on Ishiba after the LDP's repeated election losses, his resignation was inevitable,\\\" said Kazutaka Maeda, economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.\\n\\n\\\"As for potential successors, Koizumi and Takaichi are seen as the most likely candidates. While Koizumi is not expected to bring major changes, Takaichi‚Äôs stance on expansionary fiscal policy and her cautious approach to interest rate hikes could draw scrutiny from financial markets,\\\" Maeda said.\\n\\nSince the ruling coalition has lost its parliamentary majority, the next LDP president is not guaranteed to become prime minister, although that is likely as the party remains by far the largest in the lower house.\\n\\nWhoever becomes the next leader may choose to call a snap election to seek a mandate, analysts said. While Japan's opposition remains fractured, the far-right, anti-immigration Sanseito party made big gains in July's upper house election, bringing once-fringe ideas into the political mainstream.\\n\\nNearly 55% of respondents to a poll by Kyodo news agency published on Sunday said there was no need to hold an early election.\\n\\nMichael Brown, senior research strategist at financial markets brokerage Pepperstone, said there was likely to be further selling pressure on the yen and long-dated bonds on Monday.\\n\\n\\\"That selling pressure is likely to come first from the market now needing to price a greater degree of political risk, not only in terms of the LDP leadership contest, but also the potential for a general election to be held if the new leader seeks a mandate of their own,\\\" Brown said.\\n\\n'NO TIME TO LOSE'\\n\\nIshiba, a party outsider who became leader on his fifth attempt last September, wrapped up his brief tenure by completing the trade deal with Japan's biggest trading partner, pledging $550 billion of investments in return for lower tariffs.\\n\\nTrump's tariffs, especially those targeted at Japan's critical automotive sector, had forced Japan to downgrade its already weak growth outlook for the year.\\n\\nIshiba said he hoped his successor could ensure the deal is executed and Japan continues generating wage gains to assuage voter concerns over living costs.\\n\\nHe also expressed concern about the security environment his successor will inherit, pointing to an unprecedented gathering of Chinese, Russian and North Korean leaders in Beijing for a massive military parade last week.\\n\\nYoshinobu Tsutsui, chairman of Japan's biggest business lobby, Keidanren, said there was \\\"no time to lose\\\" with mounting domestic and international challenges.\\n\\n\\\"We hope the new leader will foster unity within the party, establish stable political conditions, and move swiftly to implement necessary policies,\\\" Tsutsui said.\\n\\nSome voters too are hoping for a steady hand in uncertain times.\\n\\n\\\"With all the turmoil around tariffs right now, I hope the next prime minister will be someone who can properly manage the tariff issues and handle diplomacy more effectively,\\\" Maki Utsuno, a 48-year-old chemistry researcher, told Reuters outside a busy train station in downtown Tokyo on Sunday.\\n\\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi, Nobuhiro Kubo, Makiko Yamazaki, Leika Kihara and Chang-Ran Kim in Tokyo; Additional reporting by Rae Wee in Singapore; Writing by John Geddie; Editing by

Acutis, who died of leukemia at 15 in 2006, is known in the Catholic Church as \\\"God's influencer\\\" for harnessing technology to spread the word about miracles.\",\"text\":\"ASSISI, Italy ‚Äî In the silence of St. Mary Major Church in this central Italian hill town, a tour group of Polish teenagers files past a glass-sided tomb to look in on a child of their own age. His face and hands are reconstructed with silicone. He's wearing jeans, a tracksuit top, and Nike sneakers. He is Carlo Acutis, the first millennial saint and known in the Catholic Church as \\\"God's influencer.\\\"\\n\\nOn Sunday, Acutis ‚Äî who died of leukemia when he was 15 years old in 2006 ‚Äî was canonized in a ceremony at the Vatican presided over by Pope Leo XIV, and attended by thousands of devotees of this first saint of the \\\"digital age.\\\" Witnessing the rise of the internet, cellphones and social media as a teenager, Acutis harnessed these new powers of communication and coded a website to catalogue and promote eucharistic miracles. (Eucharistic miracles involve the Catholic sacrament of Communion.)\\n\\nThe sainthood of a contemporary has inspired enthusiasm among Catholics. Saint Carlo Acutis receives prayers and requests for miracles from around the world ‚Äî often, fittingly, through the internet. His tomb is livestreamed 24/7 via a webcam. Devotees post messages to him in comments under online prayer videos on YouTube for Acutis. \\\"Blessed Carlo, thank you so much for interceding for my prayer, it's a miracle that I got a positive pregnancy test at the age of 43,\\\" reads one. \\\"Blessed Carlo ‚Äî heal me with my arthritis,\\\" reads another. \\\"My cousins lost their dog and I prayed to Carlo Acutis so they might find it, and miraculously they did.\\\"\\n\\nAssisi is home to the tombs of St. Francis and St. Clare. But now, for many of the nearly 1 million visitors who church officials say came to the diocese last year, Acutis is part of the pilgrimage. Shops sell his memorabilia ‚Äî the boy's face encased in a corona of holy light is on mugs, keychains, rosaries. Online, a wooden statue of Acutis sells for more than $14,000. The Catholic Church has had to ask police to crack down on the sale of purported locks of his hair.\\n\\nIt can take hundreds of years to be recognized as a saint. For Acutis, it has happened so quickly that his mother and father are in the rare position of being alive to witness it.\\n\\n\\\"Of course it doesn't mean that his mother is a saint,\\\" quips Antonia Salzano, when NPR asked how she feels about her son's canonization. \\\"But it's a responsibility.\\\"\\n\\nA responsibility that seems to drive and consume Salzano. The 58-year-old, dressed in black, meets NPR in the garden of a villa just a few miles from the church in Assisi where lines of visitors file past her son's tomb.\\n\\nThe interview is one of countless media appearances Salzano has made, protecting and promoting her son's image at the time that officials in the Vatican deliberated on whether to progress the application for his sainthood.\\n\\nShe rages at an article published in The Economist that quotes friends of Acutis who don't recall the teenager seeming particularly devout. (She also questions if this NPR reporter and the accompanying photographer are Catholics, implying it's to establish whether she can \\\"trust\\\" her interviewers.)\\n\\n\\\"I speak to stop nonsense spreading around about Carlo,\\\" she says. \\\"I want to make sure everything is said about him in the proper way. Carlo is an instrument of God.\\\"\\n\\nAcutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London and then moved with his Italian parents to Milan as a young boy. Salzano says he uttered his first words at 3 months old, and that by 5 months, \\\"he could speak.\\\" She would call him \\\"little Buddha,\\\" knowing there was \\\"something special\\\" about her son. In infancy, she says Acutis tried to give away new toys, saying he didn't need so much. As a boy, he asked his parents to bring blankets to the poor people on the streets of Milan where they lived. She says from the age of 7 he \\\"insisted\\\" on attending Mass every day. At 9 years old he read \\\"university-level texts\\\" on computing, and taught himself several coding languages.\\n\\nSalzano's memoir, My Son Carlo, describes the agonizing days after he fell suddenly ill, when he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia and died soon thereafter. Salzano, who was 39 at the time, says she didn't expect to be able to have more children. Until one night, when she was 43, Acutis appeared to her in a dream. \\\"He said: 'Don't worry, you will become a mother again,'\\\" she recalls. One month later, she became pregnant with twins. \\\"This was his present to his parents,\\\" she says. \\\"Each day we receive news of a miracle by Carlo; of a healing. So of course, the parents get a miracle too.\\\"\\n\\nMiracles are a prerequisite for being declared a saint in the Catholic Church. For Acutis, the Vatican recognizes two: the healing of a 4-year-old Brazilian boy with a serious pancreatic malformation, and the sudden recovery of a 21-year-old Costa Rican woman after a near-fatal bicycle accident. Vatican officials say both the mother of the young boy and the injured woman had prayed to Acutis for help.\\n\\nThe politics of becoming a saint\\n\\nTo become a saint, the Vatican's department of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints must assess a candidate's spirituality in life and their influence after death. It is a complex posthumous trial. Groups supporting a candidate for sainthood campaign to publicize their holiness.\\n\\nFor Acutis, the official process began in 2012, when the archdiocese of Milan opened a \\\"cause\\\" for his beatification. Salzano, Acutis' mother, has said in media interviews that the family supported the costs leading to his canonization. These can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. A postulator is then appointed in Rome to follow the application and bureaucratic procedures in the dicastery. (Acutis' postulator is Nicola Gori, a writer who authored the book Carlo Acutis: The First Millennial Saint.)\\n\\nArchbishop Domenico Sorrentino in Assisi, tells NPR that Acutis' lightning-fast rise is a confluence between God's will and the needs of the Catholic Church in this particular era. Acutis is a saint for young people, just at the time that the church is trying to bring more of Generation Z to Mass. \\\"Young people nowadays are so difficult,\\\" Sorrentino says. \\\"The model of a young man who found his joy, the sense of his life in Jesus, is so very important.\\\"\\n\\nThe cult of Acutis\\n\\nAcutis' modern tomb contrasts with its surroundings of ancient stone and remnants of frescoes in the 11th century church in Assisi. Like something from science fiction, the casket where the boy lies is made to look like it's levitating. The smooth stone case is made to look as if it \\\"hovers\\\" against the wall, sheared off a rock base. Below, a white light shines out from behind the casket.\\n\\nWhen NPR visited, Jo√£o Claro Pinto knelt with tears streaming down his face as his wife held their 15-month-old toddler to the glass. The family had come from Portugal to thank Acutis. \\\"Last year my son was hospitalized with meningitis,\\\" he explained afterward. \\\"I prayed very hard to Carlo. My son was saved.\\\"\\n\\nAs some faithful visit Assisi to see some of Acutis' remains and reconstructed face, other parts of the boy have been traveling the globe as relics. Anthony Figueiredo, a British priest with the Diocese of Assisi, handles a sliver of the boy's pericardium ‚Äî the sac that surrounds the heart ‚Äî that is touring the world as a religious relic. He tells NPR that he and his team have taken the pericardium, which is encased in a gold and glass frame, to nearly 25 countries in two years. It is always hand carried on the plane, he says. \\\"We would never put a saint in the hold.\\\"\\n\\nThe trips draw \\\"thousands\\\" of worshippers, Figueiredo says. In one visit to a parish in Ireland, he recalls that a crowd of over 15,000 people came ‚Äî many of them hoping to come into contact with the encased pericardium to feel close to Acutis. \\\"People can see, touch and kiss the relic as they wish, according to the local norms,\\\" he says. \\\"We believe as Catholics that saints are alive in heaven. And so they intercede before Jesus in heaven, before God.\\\"\\n\\nTo move the pericardium across international borders, Figueiredo has to secure special clearances from customs to transport human remains. But he says this has not been difficult to do. And during a recent trip to the United States, they arrived at John F. Kennedy airport to find guards waiting for them, \\\"wanting to be blessed with the relic.\\\"\\n\\nThis year, more parishes have requested a visit than Figueiredo's team can get to. The pericardium relic is expected to be in Rome for the day of Acutis' canonization.\\n\\nHaving been born in this era, Figueiredo says Acutis \\\"takes us under his wings, knowing us.\\\"\\n\\nThe saint of youth, he says, \\\"gives people hope.\\\"\",\"canonical_link\":\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/07/nx-s1-5528970/millennial-saint-carlo-acutis-canonization-catholic-church\",\"meta_site_name\":\"NPR\",\"publish_date\":\"2025-09-07T00:00:00\"}]\n"
